# my-first-blog
# 

This project is a blog posting web application where you can log in, write, post, edit your blog posts, you can also read any posted blog and if you just want the summary of a blog post you can hit the button for summarisation. I used Django framework for building this webapp, for the summarisation part, I hosted a gradio application on huggingface spaces I then call the API using JavaScript on my Django web application.
